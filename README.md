  🐚 shell scripts as <b>modules</b>
</div>

## Why this?

I'm happy to write shell scripts to accelerate my day-to-day development. And this project will collect shell scripts to become reusable modules. Which will complement [💧droplet.sh](https://github.com/ggicci/droplet.sh), a custom version of the `source` command.
